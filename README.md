Vibe Pet is a hardware desktop pet project for AI coding agents. It watches live activity from Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI coding agents in CLIs and IDEs, turns states such as thinking, tool use, waiting for approval, completed, and error into animated pets, then syncs the same state to Wio Terminal or ESP32-S3 hardware over BLE.

## Highlights

- Multi-agent pet view: every active editor or AI coding agent gets its own pet card instead of sharing one combined state.
- Real desktop pets: pets from the main window are also spawned onto the desktop, and each one can be dragged independently.
- Hardware sync: send state over Bluetooth to devices such as Wio Terminal or ESP-AI Mini Ext.
- Character switching: choose a character from [Petdex](https://github.com/crafter-station/petdex) by default or use a custom character you made.

Want to bring Vibe Pet to your own device? The BLE and Wi-Fi hardware payloads are intentionally small, so new screens, status lights, badges, and custom boards can be added without changing the desktop app.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm install`, `npm start`, and `npm run dev` install or sync hooks by default. To reinstall hooks manually:

```bash
npm run install:hooks
```

One-click install:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
./scripts/install.sh

# Windows PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install.ps1

# Windows CMD
scripts\install.cmd
```

Add `--start` to launch the app after installation, or `--dev` to start hot reload development mode.

After launch, use the desktop app to connect your device. You can also use Vibe Pet without hardware if you only want the desktop pets.

For development with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Packaging

The packaging scripts support macOS, Linux, and Windows. App bundle output goes to `dist/`.

```bash
npm run package:current
npm run package:mac
npm run package:linux
npm run package:win
npm run package:all
```

Installer output goes to `dist/installers/`. To build an installer for the current platform:

```bash
npm run build
```

Platform-specific and all-target installer commands are also available:

```bash
npm run build:current
npm run build:mac
npm run build:linux
npm run build:win
npm run build:all
```

Pass an architecture when needed:

```bash
npm run package:mac -- --arch arm64
npm run package:linux -- --arch x64
npm run build:win -- --arch x64
npm run build:linux -- --target AppImage
```

Installer defaults are DMG plus zip for macOS, NSIS for Windows, and AppImage plus deb for Linux. Installers are unsigned; release distribution may still require platform-specific signing or notarization. macOS installers must be built on macOS.

Display firmware for ESP-AI display boards, M5Stack, LILYGO, Heltec, and ESP8266 OLED boards lives in `src/firmware/esp-display-code-pet`:

```bash
pio run -d src/firmware/esp-display-code-pet -e esp_ai_common_3_tft -t upload
pio run -d src/firmware/esp-display-code-pet -e esp_ai_diy_esp32s3_oled -t upload
pio run -d src/firmware/esp-display-code-pet -e m5stack_core2 -t upload
pio run -d src/firmware/esp-display-code-pet -e lilygo_t_display_s3 -t upload
```

For ESP8266 OLED boards, set `CODE_PET_WIFI_SSID`, `CODE_PET_WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `CODE_PET_BRIDGE_URL` in `src/firmware/esp-display-code-pet/platformio.ini` so the device can poll `/api/device-snapshot`.
